## Project: AgriConnect - Reducing Food Wastage and Enhancing Agricultural Efficiency

### Overview

AgriConnect is an innovative platform designed to address the pressing issues of food wastage and high food prices in Sri Lanka. Each year, approximately 500,000 MT of fruits and vegetables go to waste due to excessive production and market inefficiencies. In addition, food inflation reached 95% in 2022, making it challenging for consumers to afford fresh produce.

Our platform tackles these issues by integrating advanced technologies to optimize farming practices and streamline the marketplace for fresh produce. 

### Features

#### For Farmers
- **Soil Analysis:** Provides detailed analysis of soil quality, enabling farmers to optimize their crop production based on soil health.
- **Crop Recommendations:** Uses data analytics and machine learning algorithms to suggest the best crops suited for the land, considering factors such as soil quality, climate, and historical yield data.
- **Disease Identification:** Employs generative AI to identify crop diseases from leaf images and generate tailored solutions for disease management.
- **Direct Sales Marketplace:** Allows farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers or wholesalers, eliminating third-party involvement and ensuring the highest possible price for their products.

#### For General Public
- **Affordable Fresh Produce:** Provides access to fresh fruits and vegetables at lower prices compared to traditional market rates.
